# Flow of a WSDC Debate

![Flow of a WSDC Debate](/debate/flow_wsdc.png)

:::warning
Allowcated time for speeches can vary based on the tournament.

# Points of Information (POI)

* A POI is a short interjection from a speaking member of the other team to the speaker on your team holding the floor. 
* Speakers can only give POIs between the first and seventh minute of the speech.

:::warning
Time allowed for POIs can vary based on the tournament.
:::

## Taking POIs

* Speaker who has the floor has a right to refuse POIs, but in general should accept about 2 POIs.
* If a speaker accepts a POI, they should give the person offering the POI adequate time to express their comment (maximum of 15 seconds).

## Offering POIs

* Only one speaker from the opposing speaking team can offer a POI at a time.
* Non-speaking members of the opposing speaking team may not offer any POIs.
* When offering POIs, speaker should not indicate the topic of their POI, e.g. by saying “on that point”.
* If a POI is rejected, they should wait ~20 secs before offering another. Badgering the speaker is poor form and is inequitable conduct.

## What happens if a speaker takes no POIs/fewer than 2 POIs?

* The decision of the overall round, regardless of the POIs taken by speakers, should be evaluated by the content coming out in the round.
* However, teams that take POIs are advantaged by being able to engage the other team’s material more. Moreover, judges can reflect in an individual speaker’s score the fact that they took no POIs.
* In very close circumstances, not taking POIs can reflect poor strategy and an unwillingness to engage.

## Specific to 3rd Speaker

### Technical WSDC Rules

* The role of the 3rd speaker is to respond to the other team's case.
* The third speech (from either team) may include a small part of their teams substantive case, so long as this was flagged in the case split announced by that teams first speaker.
* However it should be noted that third speakers are not required to include new arguments in their case.

:::warning
In some tournaments, the 3rd speaker is NOT ALLOWED to include NEW arguments.
:::

### On “New materials” at 3rd speaker

* Both 3rd speakers should respond to what has happened in the debate before their speech. **"Responding"** is a broad term covering:
     1. **Direct rebuttal** to an argument that the other team has made, which means providing a critique of the logic in the argument or providing new explanations for why the conclusion reached in the other side's arguments are wrong.
     2. **Weighing of arguments** by providing analysis of the relative importance of arguments or impacts.
     3. **Indirect comments or analysis about an existing clash point:** providing new conclusions or impacts which can be weighed against the conclusions reached by the other team.
     4. **New contextual or characterisation** analysis which broaden the understanding of conclusions reached by either team.
     5. **New examples** which provide deeper understanding of the arguments being made or existing rebuttal.
* The above-mentioned forms of responsiveness often involve new ideas, logic, examples, components of arguments or new lines of rebuttal. It is acceptable for third speakers to bring these new aspects into their speeches.
* **"Newness"** in a third speech is not sufficient justification to discredit material at third. We encourage judges to think more critically about whether material meets the definition of **"responsiveness"** as outlined above and give credit to the argument when it does.

## Specific to Reply speaker

### Technical WSDC Rules

* The role of the reply speeches is to sum up the debate from the team's viewpoint, including a response to the other team's overall case and a summary of the speaker's own team's case.
* The reply speaker may be either the first or second speaker of the team, but not the third.
* The reply speakers are in reverse order, with the Opposition reply first and the Proposition reply last.
* Neither reply speaker may introduce a new part of the team case.
* A reply speaker may respond to an existing argument by raising a new example that illustrates that argument, but may not otherwise introduce a new argument.

### On role of reply speeches

* Reply speeches are a crucial part of the debate - **they can definitely swing the result of a debate.**
* Good reply speeches do not just report on the debate that happened, but contribute to the team's overall strategy and approach in the debate, in order to shape how the debate has evolved and panned out.
* New weighing of arguments, framing, contextual observations, or examples can all serve this function and are permitted and credited in replies - however, these need to be clearly derivative of the existing events in the debate.

# Motions

## Defining the Motion

* Defining the motion is about giving a clear explanation of what the motion means to ensure that all speakers and judges are clear on the topic being debated. 
* If the two teams argue about very different things, then it becomes hard to pin down what exactly the disagreements between the teams are.

:::Note
**Example:** For the motion, "This House would allow corporal punishment in schools," the definitions for this motion should include:

* **Who** will deliver the punishment?: Will it be the school nurse, a head of discipline, or any given teacher?
* **Who** can issue the punishment?: Will it be only senior staff / all staff?
* **What** is the punishment?: Caning / Slapping / Pinching?
* **What** can the punishment be given for?: Serious breaches of behavior such as violence / repeated ignoring of the uniform policy or can it be issued at a teachers’ discretion?
:::

* Teams should think about a few things when defining the motion:
    1. **What would a reasonable intelligent person think this debate is about?**
    :::Note
    **Example:** The motion "This House would teach Intelligent Design in schools." is about teaching students about the belief that life was designed by an intelligent creator, not a motion about thinking intelligently about your art projects whilst students are designing them.
    :::
    2. **The debate should not be place or time set unless that is specified by the words of the motion.**
    :::Note
    **Example:** 
    
    The motion "This House would legalise the sale and consumption of recreational drugs." is a debate about modern day nations. It would not be fair to define it as 1960’s America prior to the war on drugs regardless of whether you believed it would make it easier for your side.

    Whilst examples can be useful to give clarity to your definition (e.g. “_we would allow their sale and consumption within private homes and cafés specifically set up for them, similar to the Dutch model for cannabis_”) they should not restrict a reasonable discussion of the topic.
    :::
    3. **What do the important words in the motion mean and are the specifics obvious?**
    :::Note
    **Example:** In the motion "This House believes that the United Nations has failed." specific criteria for failure should be given. To exemplify, do you want the criteria to be preventing war, ignoring human rights abuses or inefficient decision making procedures?
    :::

### Defining the Motion in the “Spirit of the Motion”

* A fair ‘definition’ of the motion should be offered by the first proposition speaker debate so that teams have a common understanding of the debate.

:::Note
For example, on the motion "THW allow for the sale and purchase of organs," a reasonable definition would be: "_Allowing people to receive compensation for a kidney, a portion of liver/lungs, bone marrow, etc. Critical organs can be sold by family members in cases of death._", while unreasonable definitions would be: "_Incentives for blood donation._" (unfair for opposition), "_Paying to take away your heart, brain when you are alive._" (unfair for proposition).
:::

#### Some unreasonable definitions (You should avoid them):

| Unreasonable definitions                                                                                   | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Squirreling:** Distorting the topic and defining it in a way that violates the spirit of the motion.     | “_THW ban gambling_” cannot be defined as banning risky behaviors such as taking hard drugs, as a way of “gambling with one’s life”. Gambling has an obvious meaning, which is the game, betting or staking of money or something of value, on the outcome of a a or an uncertain event whose result is determined by chance.                                                                                                                                     |
| Disallowing side opposition **room for debate.**                                                           | “_TH supports cosmetic surgery_” cannot be defined as supporting it only for burn victims. This would make it impossible for Opposition to do the debate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Refusing to debate the motion at the level of **specificity or abstraction** the motion requires.          | In “_THW restrict civil liberties in the name of national security_”, a definition that defends exclusively compulsory ID cards is too narrow. Compulsory ID cards may be an example of a national security policy that is defended by the Proposition team, but the debate extends beyond this example to a more general principle.                                                                                                                              |
| **Place-setting:** arbitrarily narrowing the debate to specific places not specified by the motion.        | In “_THW ban commercial surrogacy_”, it is not legitimate to set the debate “only in low-income nations”. Examples from these countries may be used, but the debate has a global context. However, in THW ban non-democratic countries from hosting international sporting events, Proposition can identify reasonable criteria for what constitutes a democracy.                                                                                                 |
| **Time-setting:** arbitrarily narrowing the debate to a time that is **not** the present when unspecified. | THBT citizens should engage in civil disobedience to protest unjust laws: Proposition cannot define the policy in the context of apartheid in South Africa from 1948 until the 1990s, even though they may use this as an example.<br>THBT NATO should not have withdrawn combat troops from Afghanistan: Proposition can set the context of the debate to the period when they contemplated the withdrawal of troops (2011-2014) as it’s implicit in the motion. |

* **Notes on options for Opp if a definition is unfair:**
  * There is **no obligation on Opposition to challenge** - they can choose to proceed with the faulty definition.
  * If you are persuaded that a definitional challenge is valid, this should reflect on your assessment of Proposition’s strategy (their understanding of the debate).
  * **Debates are not automatically won or lost by definitional challenges.**

![Challenges of unfair definitions](/debate/unfair_def.png)

## Types of Motions

### Policy debates - "This House Would"

_Type 1: This House Would... - This house would ban smoking._

* Prop teams may use a **‘model/policy’** to explain how they want to implement the action (not compulsory).
* In this debate, Proposition may do this through a **phased-out policy**, after which point they will levy fines on smokers. During the phase out, they will re-skill workers in the tobacco industry.
* If Proposition teams do so, the debate is then between the action in the way Proposition implements it and Opposition’s stance. Here, that would translate into banning smoking with the punishment Proposition suggests, rather than any punishment Opposition would prefer to oppose.
* Opposition can propose a **counter-model** too (once again, not compulsory), and if they do, the motion becomes Proposition model v. Opposition model. However, opposition has the **same amount of fiat** that proposition does to implement their countermodel. If they require more, they should prove that they can get it.
  * In this debate, Opposition can regulate access to smoking, tax cigarettes and even restrict it to smoking zones. In this case, the debate is between this particular model, and Proposition model.
* **Some motions make what opposition has to implement clear** in the motion itself, e.g.: THW require non-violent criminals to perform community service rather than go to prison.
* Here opposition cannot choose to model it only as house arrest, or fines.

### Policy Debates - other forms

_Type 2: A motion being phrased in a different way to “This House would...” can also be a policy motion as long as it prescribes an action that can reasonably be implemented in multiple ways, e.g.: THBT the US should should sanction Saudi Arabia._

* It is useful for Proposition to explain what sanctions and how they are phased in, and what criteria Saudi Arabia needs to meet for them to remove these sanctions.

#### Proposition Fiat

_Motion example: THW create schools that teach in endangered Indigenous languages._

* Once you read a motion, the debate rests on the assumption that the action specified in the motion can be taken – this is ‘Proposition fiat’.

**NOT LEGITIMATE AND IN VIOLATION OF FIAT:**

* ‘Because politicians are racist, they will not want to set up schools like these’ - This is a criticism that explains why this will be a hard policy to pass overall, but does not make a comment on the policy’s merits or demerits. It is not a legitimate Opposition line.
* However, Opposition can question whether Proposition policy will work in the way that proposition claims it will.

**LEGITIMATE AND PROTECTED BY FIAT:**

* These schools will not be well funded and therefore they will see lower quality of education - this acknowledges that the schools will be created, but questions how good they will be and what the impact of that will be on Indigenous children.

### “This House Believes That” Motions

_Type 1: This House believes that X... (where X is not an action being performed, but is a value judgement comparing two things):_

* Example 1: This House believes that labour unions are becoming obsolete.
* Example 2: This House believes that benevolent dictatorships are better than weak democracies.
* Example 3: This House believes there is too much money in sports.
* This type of motion does not require a policy set up (as opposed to a motion that says THW ban labour unions) and just needs proposition teams to contrast the values in the motion (e.g.: benevolent dictatorships v. weak democracies, too much money v. a world without that extent of money).
* **If a motion specifies a comparative, e.g. TH prefers X to Y, THW do X over Y, the Opposition must defend Y. They cannot create their own comparative.**
